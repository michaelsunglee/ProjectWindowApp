Project Window is an iOS app that provides users with an audio interpretation of a photo they just took. This app is intended for those with visual impairments to get a better understanding of their environment/what they are holding.

Note that the app was developed during a short hackathon so the code is not well commented/formatted and readability was not a priority. 
Here are some videos of the app in action:
